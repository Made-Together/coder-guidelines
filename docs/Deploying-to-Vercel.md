1. **Add the Project:**
   - After registering and logging into the Vercel dashboard, click on "Add New" and select "Project".
   - Connect your Github account/organisation if not already setup.
   - Select the repository from the list of GitHub repositories.

   - Click "Settings" -> "Domains"
   - Enter your custom domain
   - Click "Add" and choose if the `www.` subdomain should be redirected to the root level domain (non-`www.`) â€” Check existing site to see which redirect option to use.
   - Login to your DNS provider.
   - Ensure any existing DNS records are both backed up for safety and removed.

   - Once the DNS verification is confirmed in Vercel, Check your site domain from a private browsing window.
