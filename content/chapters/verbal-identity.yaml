            As the brighter, clearer new chapter of healthcare, our messaging needs to portray a sense of contrast from the outdated alternatives. We use parallelism to create rhythm and balance, and antithesis to highlight benefits. These techniques make our messaging memorable and impactful.

          right:
            - heading: Embrace contractions
              content: Contractions make our writing feel natural and accessible. Don't shy away from using them — we're big fans.
            - heading: Use American English
              content: Use American English, always. Watch out for those wandering S's that sneak in from British spelling.
            - heading: Start with conjunctions
              content: We're not afraid of starting sentences with conjunctions. Because we know they help to make our content snappier. And more human.
            - heading: Ampersands in headings
              content: In headings, we use the ampersand (&) instead of 'and.' It keeps titles short and sharp.
            - heading: Vary sentence length
              content: We like concise sentences, but mixing short and medium-length ones creates a sense of rhythm. And makes our content flow smoothly.
          wrong:
            - heading: No Oxford comma
              content: We don't use the Oxford (serial) comma in lists. Keep things clean and simple by avoiding that extra comma.
            - heading: Avoid semicolons
              content: We dislike the semicolon. Use an em dash for breaks in thought — or just a simple period.
            - heading: Avoid jargon
              content: We avoid jargon at all costs. If technical terms are necessary, we explain them simply to ensure accessibility for all readers.
