            Our tone of voice characteristics align with our conviction, promise

                Software development should be exciting, and so should the way
                we talk about it. We want to be lighthearted, but not whimsical.

              content: >-
                Isocolon is a rhetorical device that uses parallel phrasing —
                lines or clauses that match in length, rhythm, and grammatical
                form.


                Many key Coder messages are built on balanced, rhythmic pairings
                or trios.

                Short, clear commands or promises make the experience feel
                frictionless and user-first.

                The tightness creates a sense of speed, action, and flow —
                essential for a developer audience.

            - heading: Lead with clarity
              content: >-
                Example:  Spin up and start building.


                Why: Say the most important thing first — our audience moves
                fast.
            - heading: Cut the filler
              content: >-
                Example:  Build fast. Own fully.


                Why: Use syntactical ellipsis — skip what’s implied. Trust the
                reader.
            - heading: Speak like a human
              content: |-
                Example:  You own your workspace. We just make it seamless.

                Why: Favor direct, natural tone over technical jargon.
            - heading: Ground the promise in benefit
              content: "Example:  More productive, from day one.\t\n\nWhy: Show how the product makes life better — quickly."
            - heading: Write with energy
              content: >-
                Example:  Push code, not config.


                Why: Choose verbs with intent. Keep pace high and messages
                punchy.
            - heading: Use confident, rhythmic structure
              content: "Example:  Developer-first. Agent-ready. Secure, always.\t\n\nWhy: Parallel phrasing (isocolon) sounds decisive and polished."

            - heading: Over-explain
              content: >-
                Example:  Coder is a platform that enables cloud-based
                development environments across a range of use cases.


                Why: Too slow and corporate. Say what it does, not how it works.
            - heading: Say everything at once
              content: >-
                Example:  A secure, flexible, scalable, portable, open-source,
                self-hosted, dev-first platform.


                Why: Prioritize the message. Say one strong thing at a time.
            - heading: Get fluffy
              content: |-
                Example:  Unlock the power of limitless innovation.

                Why: Avoid abstract fluff — speak like an engineer who cares.
            - heading: Overuse jargon
              content: >-
                Example:  Persistent, containerized virtualized dev shells…


                Why: Devs know this stuff — but prefer clear, purposeful
                language.
            - heading: Lose momentum in long sentences

                Example:  Example: By enabling configuration flexibility across
                cloud-native environments, Coder lets you…


                Why: Break it up. Every sentence should drive attention forward.
            - heading: Hedge or pad
              content: "Example:  You might find this useful...\t\n\nWhy: Be bold. No need to soften or second-guess."
