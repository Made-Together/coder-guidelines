            To create a balance between our brand’s emotive character, we use FT
            System Mono for all labels, technical details and eyebrow headings.


            We can also use our Secondary Typeface in code terminals and for
            more technical-looking decorative purposes.

            When our primary and secondary typefaces aren’t available, we can
            use our system fonts for our headings, sub-headings and body copy.
            This includes platforms like Google Slides, shared documents, or
            other environments where embedding licensed fonts is not possible.
            We use these with the same rules as our brand typefaces.
