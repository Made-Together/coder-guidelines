            While Blink is often seen as a simple 2D block cursor, we also have
            moments of transition into the world of 3D space, creating
            glass-like textures that symbolize the clarity and openness that our
            products enable.

            We use a variety of angles and crops in both light and dark mode to
            create a flexible visual system. While both modes are used across
            audiences, dark mode is primarily aimed at developers, and light
            mode at enterprise leaders. This isnâ€™t a strict rule, rather a
            guiding principle. Aim for an 80/20 usage split in favor of the
            intended audience for each mode.

            When we want to be a little more subtle, we can use surface
            reflections from our supergraphic, allowing us to dial down our
            visual expression as and when we need to.
