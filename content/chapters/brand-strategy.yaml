            Coder democratizes development with coding tools that empower any
            developer to build applications, faster — minus the usual trade-offs
            between experience & security.

            Our Experience Principles are informed by research-based highlights
            that show where the industry or brand is currently at, and how we
            want to implement change to stand out and grow — informing how we
            look and how we feel.

                We believe development should be accessible to everyone. That
                means a brand that feels inviting, inclusive, and transparent:
                designed for builders, tinkerers & enterprises alike.

                Innovation doesn’t stand still, and neither do we. Coder evolves
                alongside developers, enterprises & technology itself — adapting
                and never getting in the way.

                Developers are the heartbeat of Coder. Every interaction should
                feel frictionless and empowering, giving them autonomy, speed &
                joy so they can focus on what they do best.

                coexist).
